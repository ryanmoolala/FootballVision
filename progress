Objective:

To develop simple application that can monitor and analyse football matches. 
Able to classify each player, Providing relevant data of each player.


Computer Vision Task:

Object detection is ideal for player monitoring because it efficiently locates and identifies multiple players on the pitch.
It is less computationally demanding than image segmentation, which provides unnecessary detail for this task, ensuring faster, real-time analysis.


Detect & Track Objects
Predict teams 
Tatical map representation --> use homeography transformation; a matrix multiplication

Ball Possession Rate
Player Travelled distances          
Ball & Players average speed 


Purpose of each tool

YOLOV8: Object detection; detect and classify each object in the frame

OpenCV: Object tracking; image, video processing

ByteTrack: Tracking algorithm for each player, ball

SCIKit-Learn: data mining and data analysis, used for K-Means clustering


Work flow 

1. Import necessary libraries (See requirements.txt)  ✔️
2. Test YOLOV8x.pt model; can identify images and identify players in football recording (Object detection) ✔️
3. Train Model for Object detection using custom data set
   - install cuda & cuDNN ✔️
   - download custom dataset with labelled images ✔️
   - start training using google colab ✔️
   - running analysis on every single video within a folder ✔️ (Using CUDA speeds it up A LOT)

4. Start using OpenCV for extra features
   - Video processing✔️
   - Object tracking --> player tracking✔️, referee tracking✔️, ball tracking✔️

   - Player color assignment (Differentiate players from each other)
     - K Means clustering
     - Try to fix inaccuracies
   
   - Ball interpolation ✔️
     - using pandas to interpolate
     Try to fix inaccuracies

   - Player - Ball Assigning



   - Used OpenCV to split each clip into frames
   - Used supervision and bytetrack to convert goalkeepers to players too.
   - Converted bbox of each player into ellipses
